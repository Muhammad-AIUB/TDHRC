        <h2>Who we are?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Tropical Disease and Health Research Center is a non-profit organization dedicated to reducing the burden of disease and improving the quality of life for people suffering from tropical diseases in Bangladesh. Our mission encompasses promoting evidence-based care, conducting research, strengthening healthcare delivery models, and aligning health systems with global standards.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Approximately 1.6 billion people across 149 countries in tropical and subtropical regions are affected by these diseases, particularly those living in poverty with limited access to healthcare, clean water, and sanitation. Tropical diseases cause significant illness, death, disability, and disfigurement, leading to stigma, social exclusion, school absenteeism, and lost productivity. The vicious cycle of poverty often ensnares those afflicted due to poor health and limited healthcare spending.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Our ambition is to prioritize tropical disease research and establish an equitable health system for prevention and treatment. We aim to achieve this through rigorous scientific research, evidence-based practices, policy reforms, recognition of excellence, and advocacy for increased investment in tropical medicine and health research. </p>
