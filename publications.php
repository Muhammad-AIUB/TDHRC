                <h2>Violence against physicians working in public tertiary care hospital of Bangladesh: a facility-based cross-sectional study </h2>
                <h3>Summary of the research:</h3>
                <p><strong>Background:</strong> Violence against physicians in the workplace is a prevalent global issue, and Bangladesh is no exception. Such violence significantly disrupts healthcare delivery and the attainment of universal health coverage. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the prevalence, nature, and associated risk factors of workplace violence (WPV) against physicians in Bangladesh.</p>
                <p><strong>Methods:</strong> This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at a public tertiary care hospital involving 441 physicians with a minimum tenure of 6 months. Data were gathered through a structured self-reported questionnaire, and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS V.25.</p>
                <p><strong>Results:</strong> Out of the surveyed physicians, 67.3% (n=297) reported experiencing violence, categorized as 84.5% psychological, 13.5% physical, and 2% sexual in nature. Predominant forms of psychological violence included bullying (48.8%) and threats (40.1%). The mean age of exposed physicians was 32.5±4.3 (SD) years. Those working in the emergency unit (45.8%), surgery and allied departments (54.2%), engaging in rotating shift work (70%), morning shifts (59.6%), and postgraduate trainees (68%) were frequently subjected to violence. Factors significantly associated with WPV included placement in surgery and allied departments (p<0.001), working rotating shifts (p<0.001), marital status (p=0.011), and being a male physician (p=0.010). Perpetrators were primarily identified as relatives of patients (66%). Working in rotating shifts (adjusted OR (AOR): 2.6, 95% CI: 1.2 to 5.4) and surgery and allied departments (AOR: 5.7, 95% CI: 3.4 to 9.8) emerged as significant risk factors for violence against physicians.</p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> A higher proportion of physicians at the early to mid-level stages of their careers, especially those in rotating shifts and surgery-related departments, reported incidents of WPV. Urgent intervention from policy-makers and healthcare entities is imperative to implement preventive measures. Strengthening security measures, establishing anti-violence policies, and providing comprehensive training programs are crucial steps towards ensuring a safer work environment for healthcare professionals.</p>

                <h2>Optimizing survival in Russell’s viper bite cases in low-resource setting: two case reports</h2>
                <h3>Summary of the research:</h3>
                <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Snakebite envenomation poses a significant health risk, particularly in low-resource settings where access to proper treatment is limited.</p>
                <p><strong>Case presentation:</strong> This study reports two cases of Russell's viper bites in rural Bangladesh, involving 48 and 35-year-old Bangladeshi males, respectively, and highlights the difficulties in providing adequate medical care and treating complications that may arise. Both cases involved delayed access to healthcare, initial visits to traditional healers, and the development of severe complications such as coagulopathy and renal failure. After intervention, both cases survived, which is rare in low-resource settings.</p>
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The cases underscore the importance of early recognition, appropriate management, and improved healthcare infrastructure to optimize survival outcomes in snakebite cases in resource-limited settings. These cases provide valuable insights into snakebite management and offer guidance for improving survival rates and outcomes among snakebite victims in Bangladesh.</p>

                <h2>The 2023 Dengue Outbreak in Bangladesh: Exploring the Epidemiology in Hospitalized Patients.</h2>
                <h3>Summary of the research:</h3>
                <p>For the past two decades, Bangladesh has faced recurrent dengue outbreaks, with the most recent occurring in 2023. We investigated the socioeconomic, clinical, and laboratory aspects of patients diagnosed with dengue during this outbreak. This observational study was conducted from July to September 2023 at Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Chittagong Medical College Hospital, and included 450 confirmed cases of dengue. Sociodemographic information was collected via face-to-face interviews, clinical examinations, and laboratory testing, which was done within 24 hours of admission. Dengue severity was classified according to the 2009 WHO dengue guidelines.</p>
                <p>Notably, 17% of patients experienced severe dengue, and 89% of those with nonsevere cases exhibited at least one warning sign. Most patients were young adults (mean age, 33 years), with a nearly equal male-to-female ratio. Common clinical presentations included fever (95%), myalgia (62%), and headache (58%), whereas warning signs such as vomiting (54%) and abdominal pain (39%) were prevalent. Plasma leakage indicators, including ascites, pleural effusion, and edema, were found predominantly in severe cases. Laboratory findings revealed leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated hepatic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) in nearly half of the patients. An elevated hematocrit level was associated with severe dengue.</p>
                <p>We report that a substantial number of patients developed severe dengue during the epidemic in 2023 and provide detailed clinical–epidemiological profiles of the patients, offering valuable insight into the management of dengue cases.</p>

                <h2>Predictors of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates with clinically observed seizures: A prospective observational study in a tertiary care hospital of Bangladesh</h2>
                <h3>Summary of the research:</h3>
                <p>Neonatal seizures can lead to long-term neurodevelopmental problems. This study aims to identify predictors of poor developmental outcomes in neonates with seizures to aid in early intervention and referral for follow-up and rehabilitation.</p>
                <p>This observational study was conducted in the Department of Neonatology and Institute of Paediatric Neurodisorder, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. Among 75 study cases of neonatal seizures, 23 died, and 46 were followed up at 6 and 9 months after discharge. EEGs were performed on every patient along with a comprehensive neurological examination and developmental evaluation using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley III).</p>
                <p>Three-fourths of neonates were born at term (76.1%), and over half were male (56.5%). The majority were appropriate for gestational age (79.7%) and had an average birth weight of 2607 ± 696 g (±SD). Over half of the neonates (52.2%) had adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, with global developmental delay being the most common. Recurrent seizures, the number of anticonvulsants needed to control seizures, and abnormal electroencephalograms were identified as independent predictors of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>
                <p>The study highlights the need for early referral for follow-up and rehabilitation of neonates with seizures who exhibit abnormal electroencephalograms, recurrent seizures, and require multiple anticonvulsants to control seizures.</p>
